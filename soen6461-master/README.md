# Vehicle Reservation System

## Overview of the system
Consider a company that rents out vehicles. Your assignment is to develop a web application that can handle the operations. A database holds records of vehicles and records of its clients as follows:
1. A record for a vehicle contains a type (sedan, SUV, truck), make, model, year, color, and license plate number (unique alphanumeric in the format ABC 123). Only the licence plate number is unique. An example record is shown below:

     Type:           SUV <br />
     Make:           Jeep <br />
     Model:          Wrangler <br />
     Year:           2019 <br />
     Color:          Black <br />
     Licence plate:  XCB 468 <br />

2. A client record consists of a first and last name, driver's license (unique alphanumeric, in the format A-1234-123456-12) along with its expiration date, and a phone number. Only the driver's license is unique.

## TODO

Your software system will consist of the following artifacts that must be developed in line with an iterative process:
1. A Software Requirements Specification
2. A Software Architecture Document
3. Code repository (contains application code, as well as testing, configuration, installation, and other supporting implementation)
4. A running version to be demonstrated in class.

### Setting up environment

1. Setting up the database systems on MySQL (https://github.com/ShareenAli/soen6461/wiki/Importing-Database)
2. Setting up the backend server on Node.js (https://github.com/ShareenAli/soen6461/wiki/API-Requests)
3. Running up the frontend web application (https://github.com/ShareenAli/soen6461/wiki/Frontend-react-Guide)
